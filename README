The Innovatia mobile iPhone application provides mobile ideas capture for the individual innovator
or entrepreneur.

Organisations and individuals need tools to help them improve innovation; one method with high
return on investment is improved idea management. Past research and current market tools seem to
focus on the enterprise, leaving individuals with little support for there ideas. The Innovatia project
aims at changing that by creating a software tool-based framework for individuals to innovate.

A mobile component of the Innovatia architecture allows individual innovators to actively capture
refine and share their ideas as they are created. The iPhone in particular offers an attractive platform
because of its simple effective UI and access to many mobile functions, such as networking, camera
and microphone.

You can read a little more about the app at this site I found http://app.downloadatoz.com/iphone/innovatia/. It used to be on the app store but I haven't got around to renewing it.
