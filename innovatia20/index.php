Innovatia is an open innovation initiative aimed at gathering and promoting ideas and innovation.

This is the place to post any of your ideas, or help others realize their own. We don't expect you to post your best Nobel prize winning ideas here (although we certainly encourage you to), but you can post all those ideas that you think may be needed, never had time for or maybe you think aren't that great... because someone else might!

To get started you can search for an idea. If you don't find one you want, then you can make a new one.

You can get started by looking through the Ideas List or by searching for a particular idea via the search box.

You can also add your own idea by entering the following into your address bar http://www.innovatia.org/index.php?title=New_Idea or by using the 'go' button with the search.

You can also check out the most recent ideas in the Recent Changes page.

For more information on user functions check out the Mediawiki pages.

Remember that this site is still in a Beta stage and as such is likely to be a bit unstable. Feel free to help us out by developing the layout and site further. For more complex problems and issues, email innovati@innovatia.org.
